			There are many more "tags" that come stock with HTML. Many are "deprecated", this means that you should
			refrain from using them because they are no longer supported.

			For example:

			<b>Hello!</b>
			<strong>Hello!</strong>
			both produce the same output. But strong is preferred, while b is not.
			Also remember to close your tags! Otherwise we get tag leak!

			<strong>This is bold.</strong>
			<i>This is italics</i>
			We can also link to other pages. <a href="https://www.google.com/">Look</a>
			<br>
      Also we can embbed images. See <img src="https://picsum.photos/600/500" height="500" width="600"><br>

      We can combine links and images to make link through images:

			<a href="https://www.google.com/"><img src="https://picsum.photos/600/500" height="500" width="600"></a><br>

      Generally speaking, we want to avoid using CSS from within our HTML.<br>
      But it is possible!
				<div style="font-size:5em;color:red;">Hello World!</div>
			We also want to 'generally' not use javascript within our html. But that is also possible!

      <div id="text_js"></div>

      <script>
				var textnode = document.createTextNode("hi!");
        document.getElementById("text_js").appendChild(textnode);
			</script>

      A good rule of thumb is this:
      Use HTML for templating.
      Use CSS / SASS / LESS for styling. 
      Use JavaScript for FRONTEND code. But link the JS file instead of embedding. Similarly, any other code you find you could include in your html -> leave it out.
      Let the HTML do its job.
